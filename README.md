# udacity_dog-breed-classifier
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree project

This is the second project in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program by Facebook.
In this notebook I've created a CNN model to classify images of dogs based on their breeds. And just for funsies, I've also programmed it to predict a dog breed for human faces as well, and return a cute little error message in case neither is detected.

I've used [this](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) repo to detect faces (it's really cool). And transfer learning with VGG16 and resnet152 pre-trained models to detect dogs in an image and to detect their breed respectively.

Put your images in the local_images folder to test the model on them in the last cell.
